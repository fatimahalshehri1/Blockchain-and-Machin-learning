The increasing frequency and sophistication of ransomware attacks pose a significant risk to individuals and 
organizations alike. Due to the ever-changing nature of these attacks' signatures, detecting and defending against them is a 
formidable challenge. Our research proposes an innovative method that leverages blockchain technology and machine learning 
algorithms, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, to improve ransomware detection and defense. We have developed a 
blockchain and machine learning-based ransomware detection system that provides a robust and efficient real-time solution for 
detecting and mitigating ransomware attacks. By combining these cutting-edge technologies, our system provides a potent new 
defense against this escalating cybersecurity threat.
